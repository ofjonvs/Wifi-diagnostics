Wi-Fi Diagnosis
We all need internet connectivity in this age of lockdowns.  What steps should you go through when you do not have connectivity?  





Build an application that will step through some possible problems to restore internet connectivity.  Assume that your computer uses wi-fi to connect to a router which connects to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) which connects to the Internet.
Academic Honesty Policy – Do your own work!  Each project submission will be compared against other submissions from current and previous semesters.  

Good Faith Attempt (GFA) Requirement –
•	Test your project with a minimum of 4 test cases to ensure that your project is working correctly 
•	Capture your test runs (actual vs. expected results) in your write-up 
o	A 28% deduction will be imposed to any project that did not include student test cases and their respective test results
•	Your submission will not satisfy the GFA if these requirements are not met   
•	Testing your code is very important





•	Creation of a driver class 
•	Pseudo-code
•	Java fundamentals, including decision structures 
•	Following a flow-chart
•	Command-line processing
  





•	Class - WiFiDiagnosis
•	Source code - WiFiDiagnosis.java
•	INCLUDE your name as the author on every Java file that you are creating for all CMSC 203 projects

 


•	Write a program based on the following flow-chart
•	This class should contain a main method. 
•	The diagnosis will be based on the following flow-chart:

 
Prompt the user at each step, and if they respond that the step they took fixed the problem, exit the program.
You are required to run the application from the command line and from an IDE (like Eclipse). Take screenshots of two runs of your program with different inputs, one from the command line and one from your IDE.





If you have a problem with internet connectivity, this WiFi Diagnosis might work.

First step: reboot your computer
Are you able to connect with the internet? (yes or no)
no
Second step: reboot your router
Now are you able to connect with the internet? (yes or no)
no
Third step: make sure the cables to your router are plugged in firmly and your router is getting power
Now are you able to connect with the internet? (yes or no)
yes
Checking the router's cables seemed to work

First step: reboot your computer
Are you able to connect with the internet? (yes or no)
no
Second step: reboot your router
Now are you able to connect with the internet? (yes or no)
no
Third step: make sure the cables to your router are plugged in firmly and your router is getting power
Now are you able to connect with the internet? (yes or no)
no
Fourth step: move your computer closer to your router
Now are you able to connect with the internet? (yes or no)
no
Fifth step: contact your ISP
Make sure your ISP is hooked up to your router. 





Deliverables / Submissions and Deliverable format: 

The Java application must compile and run correctly, otherwise Project grade will be 0.
The deliverables will be packaged as follows. Two compressed files in the following formats:
•	FirstName_LastName_Project.zip – a compressed file in the zip format, with the following:
•	Source Code: WiFiDiagnosis.java
•	Design: pseudo-code
•	Test Plan (test cases, for each test case provide screenshot of the running application)
•	Screenshots:
o	One screenshot of the application running from the command prompt.
o	One screenshot of the application running in your IDE.
o	Screen shot of Java file (WiFiDiagnosis.java) in your GitHub repository
•	Lessons Learned: Provide answers to the questions listed below:
o	Write about your Learning Experience, highlighting your lessons learned and learning experience from working on this project. 
o	What have you learned? 
o	What did you struggle with? 
o	What would you do differently on your next project? 
o	What parts of this assignment were you successful with, and what parts (if any) were you not successful with?
o	Provide any additional resources/links/videos you used to while working on this assignment/project. 
	For Project 1, see sample 1st and final submission write-ups.
•	Source Code: WiFiDiagnosis.java
	Documentation within a source code should include 
o	comments for each method.
o	additional Comments to clarify a code.
o	one block comment at the top of each program containing the course name, the project number, your name, the date, and platform/compiler that you used to develop the project, for example:

/*
 * Class: CMSC203 
 * Instructor:
 * Description: (Give a brief description for each Class)
 * Due: 2/09/2021
 * Platform/compiler:
